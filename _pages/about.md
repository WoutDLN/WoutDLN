Hello! I am Wout Dillen, a Senior Lecturer in Library and Information Science at the [University of Borås](https://www.hb.se), Sweden, where I am co-coordinating the local node of [Huminfra](https://www.huminfra.se), the national Swedish DH infrastructure project. 

In 2015, I completed my Ph.D in Literature at the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/), where my dissertation focussed on Digital Scholarly Editing in the field of Genetic Criticism. As part of this project, I also developed the [Lexicon for Scholarly Editing](https://lexiconse.uantwerpen.be). In 2016, I held an Experienced Researcher fellowship in the Marie Skłodowska-Curie ITN on Digital Scholarly Editing called [DiXiT](https://dixit.uni-koeln.de). Afterwards, as a postdoc, I have functioned as the coordinator of the Antwerp node of [CLARIAH-VL](https://clariahvl.hypotheses.org), the Flemish contribution to the European Research Infrastructures [DARIAH](https://www.dariah.eu) and [CLARIN](https://www.clarin.eu).

As a Senior Lecturer, the focus in my teaching is on digital skill training, specifically by organizing hands-on workshops on DH-related technologies, such as `XML`, `HTML`, `CSS`, GitHub, etc., and developing the students’ critical attitude when working with these technologies in a research context. 

I am also currently the Secretary of the [European Society for Textual Scholarship](https://textualscholarship.eu), and Steering Committee and Executive Board member of [DH Benelux](https://dhbenelux.org). I am also the General Editor of the academic journal [Variants](https://journals.openedition.org/variants/1190), the deputy editor of the journal [Information Research](https://informationr.net/infres), and on the editorial board of the [Journal of the DH Benelux](https://journal.dhbenelux.org).
